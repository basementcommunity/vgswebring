  As I was reading <a href="https://www.schifferbooks.com/the-snes-omnibus-the-super-nintendo-and-its-games-vol-1-am-6439.html" target="_blank">The SNES Omnibus by Brett Weiss</a> I noticed that he included a lot of great
  game quotes from sites i'd never heard of.  As an <a href="https://cheerfulghost.com" target="_blank">independent game site</a> creator I
  realized that a tool to help discover independent and lesser known sites would be useful
  to the larger game community.  In a couple days I hacked out a prototype and
  started collecting a list of game sites.  I decided to model the base website on
  old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring" target="_blank">90's Webrings</a> and Stumbleupon.
