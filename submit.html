<p>
  The goal of this webring is to point to game sites that might not get the attention they deserve.  That said,
  this goal isn't mean to be exclusive but provide some kind of curation to keep it managable.  If you have a
  game site not in this list or have any questions contact me!
</p>

<p>
  To get your site added to the list <a href="about.html">contact me</a> or submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/" target="_blank">GitHub pull request</a> which <a href="https://github.com/jdodson/vgswebring/blob/master/webring.txt" target="_blank">adds the site to our list</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Make sure to add a link back to the Video Game Site Webring too as that's what keeps the webring alive!
